# Huffman

This repo explores Huffman Coding, which is commonly used for lossless compression. 

The data folder contains data files, including both text and image files. The source code can be found in the `\src` folder, with decompression and compression mainly located in the respective HuffMainDecompress and HuffMainCompress files. The HuffProcessor class contains helper methods, some of which are used in both compression and decompression.
